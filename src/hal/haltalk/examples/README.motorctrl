This is the demo app I described in my mail this morning

see motorctrl.hal for what it does

run like so:

 $ . machinekit/scripts/rip-environment
 # display the uuid
 $ echo $MKUUID  
 $ cd machinekit/src/hal/haltalk/examples
 $ halrun -I motorctrl.hal

to exit, type 'exit' to the halcmd: prompt.

in a separate window, or remote, run this, replacing <uuid> with 
the value from echo $MKUUID above:

 $ gladevcp -S <uuid> motorctrl.ui

one could also directly connect to fixed URI's like so, without zeroconf:

   gladevcp -C <cmd_uri> -M <rcomp_uri>  <UI file> 
for example:
   gladevcp -C tcp://193.228.47.204:49154 -M tcp://193.228.47.204:49153  motorctrl.ui

to debug gladevcp, add '-D 1' to the arguments.

halscope, and the UI should come up

it is in fact possible to trigger the scope by the 'trigger scope' UI
button, but the scope scaling is still off

to complete the demo, you need to:

- connect a motor and link commanded position to signal 'cmd-pos'
- hardware led/button:
  comment out 'net led motorctrl.led1 <== motorctrl.togglebutton1'
  link in real led, reak button as appropriate
