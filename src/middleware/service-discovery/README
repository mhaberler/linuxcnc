Service Discovery:

A client requires a set of services: protocol, version, instance etc

To obtain those at runtime, a UDP broadcast request/unicast reply scheme is
DHCP-style. Eventually this might get replaced by the zmq UDP transport
once that gets implemented, but the pattern will remain the same.

The files udpsdpublish.py and udpsdlookup.py are the 'living protocol specs'
since it's so trivial.
