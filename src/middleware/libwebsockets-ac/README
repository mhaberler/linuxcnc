** DISCLAIMER: **
This is an EXPERIMENTAL (HACKED) version of libwebsockets forked from the
original version:

	http://git.libwebsockets.org

The library has been forked towards modifying the interface to facilitate the
creation of Python bindings and a SockJS-protocol layer on top of that.

It was done as a prototype/proof-of-concept for NYTD. Libwebsockets has
performed *exceedingly well* for us relative to other solutions.

The curious should feel free to play with this fork. However, be aware of the
following:
 - The implementation of the new features are likely to change significantly as
   this project is moving beyond being a prototype. Expect frequent updates and
   instability.
 - The libev integration and body parsing are very kludgey and are going to be
   cleaned up and refactored shortly. Watch for frequently changing interfaces!
 - This fork does not include and of the canonical libwebsockets bugfixes since
   the original fork!

Once the changes have been cleaned up and made stable, this repo will get merged
back into the canonical libwebsockets repo - contingent upon the author's
approval. :)

** Fork Features: **
This version provides:
 - libev event loop (on by default)
 - external poll support is OFF by default
 - Support for POST/OPTIONS http methods
 - Parsing of the following headers:
 - * "If-None-Match"
   * "Content-Type"
   * "Content-Length"
   * "Access-Control-Request-Headers"
 - Support for receiving POST payloads from clients:
 - * This is currently SLOPPY with a compile-time determined buffer size

** And now back to your regularly scheduled programming: **
This is the libwebsockets C library for lightweight websocket clients and
servers.  For support, visit
